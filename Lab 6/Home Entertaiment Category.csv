0,Perfect Bridge to view security cameras remotely!!,"Rather than purchasing Arlo  remote viewing services per month:  This Home Pod Mini device works with the iPhone ""Home"" app as a bridge so that remote viewing of my Arlo Ultra security cameras are available without additional cost!  It works GREAT!  I'm SO pleased to have remote access to my cameras at no additional monthly cost!  Yes, Siri has MANY more options for usage but for the moment, I'm pleased with just the bridge option.  If your considering the same usage, be sure to check the compatibility of your Arlo Hub with the Home Pod Mini.  I'm using a VMB5000 Arlo Hub, which is compatible.Read full review...",5 stars
1,Poor sound quality ,I have a new one directly from apple the store.This used / refurbished sound quality is poor & not the same as new 1000%& I had to do a hard resetCodes didn't work & smoke & mirrors,1 stars
2,Easy set up. easy to use. Get 2 for stereo,"I play it mostly as low level background but it plays loud also. Seems like it has software loudness correction that is well done. Well controlled. Not boomy. It can articulate the sound of picks on strings and different types of cymbal strikes. Where the drumstick hitting cymbal not just the crash. Obviously sound out depends on source quality. Very reasonable compromise of physical size, sound quality and ease of use. I have spent extended periods of time listening to systems that cost as much as new cars and I enjoy listening to music through the homepods.Read full review...",5 stars
3,"Great product, Sounds awesome, looks brand new. Best sounding smart speaker I have.","HomePod was in good shape. Opening the package I noticed a corner of the HomePod packaging was damaged (slightly). Thankfully the product was fine at first inspection. The box wasn’t in the original plastic wrap (as it is used). It came in the original box and had the instructions pack without the Apple sticker. Plugging it in I didn’t get the welcome message from Siri. The first thing it said was it can’t connect to the internet. It also wouldn’t connect to my phone (like it should out of the box). I had to factory reset the HomePod to connect to it. After finally connecting to it (and updating it) I got to hear this HomePod for the first time. I do have another HomePod that I purchase new and compared it to it. I must say It sounded just as great as the other one that I bought new.My only complaints would be is that it wasn’t factory reset as the description indicated. Being tech savvy it wasn’t that huge a deal and was easy to reset.Overall I’m very happy this purchase, it’s sounds good and works as it was intended. I would definitely by this product again!Read full review...",5 stars
4,"Homebod, is just not another fancy speaker.. it is new expe","very nice to have such product in home..I thought it was just a new fancy speaker with high quality sound... it turned out to be a very fine digital immersion experience, kids immediately got used to this and using Siri in a way I never thought possible :-)I'm considering having new homebods for other rooms and halls in my house...Read full review...",5 stars
5,Apple HomePod - A Great Speaker!,"I have a Samsung smart TV but the sound is absolutely AWFUL. Have debated and put off purchasing a sound at for years. I’m neck deep in the Apple ecosystem so read up on the HomePod and HomePod mini. Even though it is now discontinued, I decided to give it a shot. I am a happy owner! I now have a tv with really terrific sound and listening to music is awesome. It is not a cheap solution. But the quality, ease of use, style and size make it a win for me. I’m glad that made the purchase!Read full review...",5 stars
6,The best shop,I already had two HomePods (1 in living room and another one in the bedroom) and decided to get the 3rd to pair it in stereo mode in the living room. I paid full price for the first two and i know how they come packed and this is where the difference is.  It comes packed in the original box a little stressed and in the inside forget about everything nicely packed. The Pod itself comes inside a cheap plastic bag that comes inside the stressed original box and no documents at all. All of that i really don’t care at all since the important thing is absolutely clean and new. The HomePod i received was in a mint condition and even when it didn’t come with the plastic sticker on top of it there was no sign of use. I am very happy with my purchase and absolutely regret my other two purchases in the store. I absolutely recommend this!It arrived one day before.Read full review...,5 stars
7,Great sound in a small form,"The original HomePod is expensive, but I wouldn't call it overpriced for the sound quality and with the integration that it has. One sounds impressive for the size, two together sound impossibly full without a subwoofer. They automatically sync up with AppleTV to remove video/audio latency, and you can pause/roll back/etc with ""hey Siri"". Looks great anywhere too. One annoyance is that you can't AirPlay video from another device to the AppleTV and then have the audio forward on to the HomePod.Read full review...",5 stars
8,Rich sound in a small package....,"Bought this speaker for a very small home office - wanted something that could fill the room with rich sound without taking up much space, and this fit the bill. I own an iMac, and made the HomePod the default speaker so now anything I stream or watch on the computer sounds great. Only complaint is Siri needs work on it's comprehension skills - occasionally it gives me a song that is completely different than what I requested, and repeated efforts to get Siri to understand me can be frustrating. Hopefully over time Siri will get smarter...Read full review...",5 stars
9,Excellent product / excellent seller,"The HomePod is amazing. This is my second one and for a barely used one you can’t beat the price. The sound quality is absolutely amazing and with AirPlay and Siri it’s so easy to listen to music, podcasts etc.Read full review...",5 stars
10,Great Product,Great product. I have six of them in my home. Produce excellent sound. Very satisfied with the purchase and the value.,5 stars
11,Works better/easier than expected,"It just works. Simple to setup and simple to add devices to. Two weaknesses that I wasn't aware of before buying.1. You can only connect one phone account to the HomePod, but multiple can control via voice control. Not a deal breaker, but it would be nice if all of the devices on your home would be able to pair with it.2. Doesn't create audible alerts for intercom function or an audible ""beep"" from a sensor being triggered.Overall the sound quality is better than the BOSE Companion speakers it replaced. The bass isn't anything to joke about, good low end and great overall sound.Read full review...",5 stars
12,Heavyweight baby with awesome sound quality.,"Product came like brand new, no problems with connection. Also no weird noises and bugs. Good way to save about 30% of original price.",5 stars
13,One of the best sounding self powered speakers on the market.,"The Apple HomePod is one of the best self powered speakers available at its price. It is just very sad that Apple have stopped producing them and we have to put up with the appalling HomePod mini which is a much inferior product. You do not buy the HomePod for the AI assistant (Siri) as it not that good and is inferior to Amazon's Alexa, but you do buy them for their sound, which is extraordinary. I now have 3 pairs of HomePods and we love them. They are well worth the money (original price) and the limited Siri functionality is enough to get music streaming and the AirPlay connectivity allows you to play from any Airplay compliant device.Negatives are few: lack of BT  and a hardwired connection. You can only connect to these speakers through Airplay or have them stream your music library from iCloud, but they sound so good you can forgive them this shortcoming.Read full review...",5 stars
14,Great quality sound with reliable wireless connection,"Pairing two of these produces a remarkable sound. The clarity of these speakers is wonderful. I'm replacing an older pair of bookshelf speakers. They were good, but the HomePod is much better. It's great that I can connect to these from the iPhone, iPad or iMac from anywhere in the vicinity without wires.Read full review...",5 stars
15,Apple Homepod,"Love this! Great sound quality, especially if you have a few of them scattered around. In fact, I put 11 of them around the house. Can be used individually or 2 can be paired in stereo, which sounds awesome!Also using as a base station for Apple Home Kit. Works great! Very pleased.Read full review...",5 stars
16,Unbelievable product,"I never wanted to buy this speaker, I couldn’t justify the price plus every singe picture I have ever seen of the HomePod makes it look no bigger than an egg and I couldn’t imagine such a tiny device to sound and work so well, but this is actually a very nice size, it’s really heavy for its size too, this thing is so unbelievable that I’m already planning on getting 3 more for the house..  let me say that I have lots of Apple stuff, but I loathe Siri, I wish I could uninstall her from my iPhone X but on the HomePod with 6 or 8 microphones Siri is completely spot on, she don’t miss a thing at all, this is seriously a perfect speaker..Read full review...",5 stars
17,Sounds good…not as smart as Alexa.,"We don't like Amazon eavesdropping all day long, so we switched to HomePod for the few smart home devices we have.The audio quality on this is great! So it's good to stream music to, or just request some music from our music library. Siri handles the basics well, like the weather and basic information, but the general interaction isn't as good with Alexa, such as jokes and more nuanced discussions.Read full review...",4 stars
18,Hardware is great!,"Works as advertised. Bass goes deeper than my HK Go Play (can’t get nearly as loud though). It sounds absolutely phenomenal at all volume levels and the bass shines through at low to mid levels.r>Siri isn’t as intelligent as my friends google smart speaker, but that can be changed with future software updates. Apple nailed the hardware with this one. Good investment.Read full review...",5 stars
19,Great speaker and complement to your Apple Ecosystem.,HomePod is a beautiful speaker with astonishing audio quality and magic features that pair beautifully with other Apple products. Simple and easy to use. Very recommended.,5 stars
20,Super smart excellent quality speaker,Way better than Alexa. Great sound quality,5 stars
21,Awesome sound,"Really full, rich sound. This device is even more awesome in stereo.Siri works well for selecting songs and turning on/off homekit devices. Sometimes there are issues understanding what is requested, but most cases are straightforward and work correctly.You don’t buy the HomePod to be amazed by smart technology, but you  will likely be amazed by the sound! And you can pair two devices for excellent stereo sound.Read full review...",5 stars
22,Great sounding speaker with a lot of untapped potential,"I really give this speaker a 3.5 stars as it currently stands.  It sounds amazing but the voice control is useless for anything but controlling Apple Music and asking Siri questions. My understanding is that the new version of iOS will allow voice control of Spotify.  If that happens I will be at a 4.5 star rating.  I only have one of these, but if the Spotify voice control is added I will be adding another for stereo sound. Great speaker with a lot of untapped potential as it currently stands.  Crossing my fingers.Read full review...",4 stars
23,Excellent sound and access for people in the Apple Eco-Verse,"Apple's home speaker is a great connection to your Apple Music, iTunes/Music app music and if you are going to stream from a service and not invest in a full home stereo.This is not, at present, a home assistant as Siri is not nearly as broadly capable as competitors in that arena.The value and whether I would recommend it I left uncompleted because for some people it is yes and for many others it would be no. Circumstances are all in this case.Read full review...",4 stars
24,Great sound but best for those firmly in the Apple ecosystem,Sound is excellent and it recalibrated itself to its position in the room when moved. Makes a great external speaker for my iMac. Going to buy a second one to have a stereo pair.,5 stars
25,HomePod for the win!,Really easy to setup and use.  Turn on “Hey Siri” and you have a great alternative to those ‘other things’ that only end up using what you just asked for to fill your inbox with ads.,5 stars
26,Less than I thought ,"Was hoping more of this Apple product, wifi connection problems and not the high quality sound offer by other brand product’s. Anyway it’s funny to talk to Siri… not the best, yet recommended ",4 stars
27,HomePod can compete!,I bought this HomePod as a trial to see if it could compete with my Bose system. The sound on this system was really good even better than my Bose speakers. For the price and the ability to use Apple HomeKit it was well worth itRead full review...,5 stars
28,Audiophile grade product,If you're using this with your Apple gear you will not be disappointed; I have two of them as stereo setup surrounding an iMac and it's amazingI have paradigm studios and prestige speakers for two other systems in my home with marantz and emotiva and parasound amps -- that's my audiophile backgroundIf you're worried about not having droid capability or BT connectivity or portability then do not buy this and look for another productRead full review...,5 stars
29,Ideal assistant & speaker,"Connected to AppleTV, and my phones, tablets etc I’m enjoying having Siri available in various rooms in my house. I can play music, movies, tv shows, open apps and get all kinds of news, weather you name it. And the sound is amazing for such a small speaker Read full review...",5 stars
30,favourite Apple product,"some say it's a niche product, the sound quality is amazing for a speaker this size, if you want the best sound quality, this is the small speaker to get. and yes, it plays Spotify - just hit Airplay from within the Spotify app.Read full review...",5 stars
31,Works like a charm with great Sound,"Worked as expected and the sound quality is excellent, better than Google or Amazon.  It has less features though",5 stars
32,"Great price, just do a factory reset.",Great product.  Great price for an open box Homepod.  Only thing to note is that you'll need to do a factory reset.  Mine was still paired to a past user's device and I noticed another reviewer had that issue as well.  Minor problemRead full review...,5 stars
33,Works good. ,Product works good. Had it for about two weeks now. Just had to reset it to factory settings to sync with my phone. Other than that works great.,5 stars
34,Great addition to homekit,Loaded quick to homekit and runs great. Really like it. I held out for a long time before getting one. Like the intercom feature.,5 stars
35,Best sound quality,"The speaker fits very well into all-things Apple. I own a lot of Apple products and it just makes sense, especially with Apple Music. The sound is the best part. From such small package, it beats some of the older large room speakers I’ve owned! This is amazing technology!Read full review...",5 stars
36,HomePod has great sound but best for Apple enthusiasts,"Sound is unparalleled a speaker this size. Setup is quick and easy. It only really works well with other Apple products so if you are committed to Apple, you can’t go wrong with HomePod.",5 stars
37,Big things come in small packages,"I was totally blown away at the volume of the music coming out of these tiny beast. The clarity is extremely great as well. If you don’t have one, you are missing out. I got two and set up as stereo.. OMG!!Read full review...",5 stars
38,HomePods rock,Appeared fo be nearly new and arrived quickly. Reasonable price. Set up easily and is great fun learning more and more of what they can do. I bought two for stereo and they sound great.,5 stars
39,"Less versatile than Alexa, but the sound is AMAZING!","I bought this HomePod to play music in my iTunes Match.  I have an Amazon Echo Show and an Echo Dot.  While I was happy with them, neither would play iTunes songs.The HomePod is somewhat less versatile than the Alexa devices, but the sound is far better.Setup was a breeze - Download the Home app on my iPhone, plug in the HomePod and everything else is automatic.Read full review...",4 stars
40,"Great sound, good product!","Great sound!  I read many reviews before buying this speaker.  It is everything they said and more.

42,Good purchase,Brand new except for the missing charger and easy to set up. Works well,5 stars
43,Overpriced but Love it,We have a small place with an open plan. This fills up the room with good fidelity for both music and Apple TV use. Should be closer to $300 new in price but we love the unit. ,5 stars
44,Home Kit win,Pretty cool --- got it for the home kit features.,5 stars
45,Good sound quality and easy setup,Everything about this speaker is good except that it's not really a true Bluetooth speaker in the sense that you can't just pair it with any bluetooth device and expect it to work as an external Bluetooth speaker.Read full review...,4 stars
46,High Quality Speaker,"It’s an awesome device. Unfortunately there are not a whole lot of compatible smart devices that it controls. Still if you love Apple, Apple Music, and Siri, then this is one heck of a great device!",5 stars
47,Great Sound. Easy Setup,"Works great to give excellent stereo with my original homepod.  I had no trouble pairing them,  The setup process even asked if the new pod was on the left or the right.",5 stars
48,HomePod is a asset to the Apple Escosystem,It’s a very good product if you are in the Apple Ecosystem. I love mine.Especially when you can get it at a good price like i did. Hope i can get a second one.,5 stars
49,Nice and well designed,Surprisingly good sound in a small package DO NOT TRY TO PAIR THEM AS YOUR COMPUTER SPEAKERSit will make you self-destruct.,4 stars
50,Awesome,"This little speaker sounds incredible. I’m pretty picky about audio quality, and the HomePod is probably the best sounding speaker this size. Siri seems to be improving, and HomePod are great for my smart home.Read full review...",5 stars
51,HomePod mini’s rock!,Great for creating a multi room sound system if you are an Apple product user. Sound quality is nice and crisp. If you want more bass go with the full size HomePod.,5 stars
52,Amazing,"Coming from an audio and Apple fan ,(I have a huge $1,600 system in my car) I can definitely say I love this . Any reviews you here talking crap about it especially talking crap about the fact that it’s an Apple product and so it only works with other Apple products, you should immediately discredit as naysayers. You can airplay whatever you want on to the HomePod , literally whatever you want games movies music phone calls podcast YouTube videos it’s Bluetooth but only for Apple products , aka, airplay. this thing sounds amazing it is the ultimate “Bluetooth” home  speaker for an Apple fan and I love that I can just tell it what to do and it will automatically play it without me having to use my phone it sounds amazing and It can hear you from upstairs and across the house no joke I’ve done it multiple times super good speaker sounds very good impresses any one that hears it.Read full review...",5 stars
53,"Good things come in small sizes 
","Bought to pair two in stereo and wow, it took what was good sound for my office to great sound!  Still love my larger HomePods more, but these are so small for their sound ",5 stars
54,Excellent speaker. Needs ability to EQ.,"Excellent speaker, however it can have too much bass at times, so where you place it is important.  If Apple allowed you to EQ the speaker, it would be amazing!",4 stars
55,Love the HomePod,Let me start by saying I love this speaker and ended up buying more. This speaker has gotten a lot of uninformed reviews on youtube and there's been so many conflicting accounts about what it does and what so and so thinks. Who cares? Don't worry about what Android users or Spotify users think about the HomePod.  I never ask them what they think about my phone not that it's ever stopped them from inflicting their opinions on me.  It's not for them and that's why it was perfect for me. I love the build and quality. I've purchased 4 so far for the house and I love them. I'm also a long time Sonos user and have other AI speakers in the house but for the above reasons and because I love/use other Apple products I almost always use the HomePod everyday which I can't say about the others. It's ok to have competing products and use the ones you love. You know what's right for you and in this case the HomePod is the right speaker for me and my needs.Read full review...,5 stars

59,Great Product!,"Great product, easy to set up and use! Great sound! Not room filling bass, but overall good audio",5 stars
60,Better stereo than soundbar,All Apple products are 5 star. I bought one HomePod Mini. Sound was so good I decided to buy another one for stereo. Result is terrific. ,5 stars
61,Great sound!,This is the best of the “smart” speaker in terms of sound quality. Siri isn’t great but you already knew it. The microphone is really good at picking up commands from a distance.,5 stars
62,my few cents,"great sound quality in a compact frame only downside i can see is needing a phone for initial setup and that cable cannot be easily extendedbut those are minor things, and the quality of the sound and the dynamic range of sound are great!Read full review...",5 stars
63,It is the sound that makes this product stand out.,"The sound is so amazing that I bought a second one to run a stereo setup.  If you are into sound quality, this is the best on the market in my opinion.",5 stars
64,Best value for money ,"The homepod is worth every cent i spent in it. Sound quality is amazing, build material is super premium, and the siri integration seals everything else",5 stars
65,Typical high Apple quality,Have 2 and wanted a third. Apple no longer sells them so bought this one used. Very happy with it. Like new.,5 stars
66,Great sound at a more reasonable price,"Great to use for a desktop setup.  Not the best ""smart"" speaker...look elsewhere if that is what you want, but like everything Apple the HomePod works pretty seamlessly in your setup.",5 stars

69,Great,"Sound quality is amazing, particular when paired with another for left/right Stereo.  Even solo, they produce surprisingly full volume from a small sphere.",5 stars
70,Great sound!,"To me the most important part of a speaker is the sound quality. I am not so lazy I’m unable to bring up the Amazon web site if I want to buy something.I was very concerned if there could be decent bass not to mention volume out of such a small speaker.  This speaker exceeds my expectations.  The sound is some of the best I’ve heard.I still think you need two for stereo.  But with all the processing of the sound field available today, one could probably get a pretty decent imitation of surround sound.Read full review...",5 stars
71,Great quality and love that it controls my home.,I replaced a Bose speaker with this device and I’m very happy with my decision. The quality is great. Love that it works with HomeKit and Siri,5 stars

78,"Great sound, Siri needs a little work","As for the sound:I have no idea how they got such a solid low end to the music, not boomy, just smooth lows, and the vocal are super clear, its a pleasure to listen to.As for the tech:Siri is not as refined as the Google assistant. It does work with Spotify and other music apps, but its best with Apple Music because its built in, with 9.99 a month subscription mind you.Read full review...",5 stars
79,Nicer sound than Sonos,"Too many want to discuss its value accepting verbal commands. IT'S A SPEAKER. The sound is full at low to medium volume and vastly superior to the Sonos Play1 and the Sonos One that I already own. The bass is pumped up at lower volumes but the end result is very pleasant. I will be phasing out the Sonos products and replacing them with the HomePods. For serious listening, I have larger speakers and a powerful amp but for casual listening, I will be using these.Read full review...",5 stars
80,Just as hoped it would be,Product packed nicely and in perfect shape. Thank you. ,5 stars
81,Awesome,HomePod is the best speaker for the size. Having two of them enables Dolby atoms surround sound which is amazing for movies and music. Well worth it. ,5 stars
