0,What a pleasant surprising little table.,"It's really great and I wasn't sure I'd think that. It's adjustable to perfect heights for me to use my laptop without having to balance it on my knees or a tray. It was a skoosh to assemble. It's neat and is easily folded down or just the legs pushed under the couch. You look at these things in magazines and say ""that's for old folks"" well it's not. They are actually a simple but very effective design. My laptop doesn't move around  it's quite secure. There's a decent amount of space on it. So surprisingly pleased with my purchase. It'll be interesting how long I get to keep it before the household think it's also a good idea.Read full review...",5 stars,"What a pleasant surprising little table.

4,You get what you pay for!,"I’m suprised at how many bad reviews there are for this table. It’s £10 including delivery to your door, what do people expect?Received my table, no instruction on hoW to put it together but it’s very simple to figure it out.It’s very lightweight and not the most sturdy but it will hold a plate of dinner. How long it lasts is yet to be seen but ours will only be used on rare occasions so it will suit us fine I’m sure.If you are looking for something that is going to take heavier, prolonged use then I suggest spending a bit ore and get something more sturdy.Read full review...",3 stars,"You get what you pay for!

6,Not a good purchase. ,"This table is extremely poor quality, even for the money I paid for it!I purchased it for my 95year old Mum, who is staying with us due to our necessary self isolation. I needed something that she could push away easily from her chair when she needs gets up. Yes the table does do that! But, it is so flimsy I had to add wooden struts to it to stop it collapsing. When set to flat table top setting the table top actually tipped slightly backwards. So a bit more do-it-yourself to correct that. I now have a reasonably stable table she can safely use for her cups of tea etc. But had this been normal ‘times’ & the table hadn’t been desperately needed, there is no way I would have kept this item. I would not recommend this item. Read full review...",1 stars,"Not a good purchase.

7,My View of the Folding Table.,"I was not that impressed with these but for the price they do the job, The fault that I found was that the inner leg tube was too loose and when you went to store the table away the legs slid down and a couple of times they fell out of the outer tube but, as I said, they do the job.

22,this has made such a difference so an elderly lady who kept dropping her dinner from a normal tray.  This has given her so much more confidence,"this replaced a beanbag tray that an elderly friend was using.  The beanbag tray kept sliding and she had tipped her dinner on the floor a few times.  We tried this tray and what a difference it has made to her life.  No more lost dinners, easy to slide away once she has finished eating and sturdy enough to keep food and drinks on without sliding.  An absolute bargain and has helped her gain confidence again and given her independence.Read full review...",5 stars,"this has made such a difference so an elderly lady who kept dropping her dinner from a normal tray.
